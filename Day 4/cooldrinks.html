    <h1>Cool Drinks</h1>
    <p>"Cold drinks," or soft drinks, are non-alcoholic beverages, typically carbonated, containing water, sweeteners, and flavorings. They are also known as soda, pop, or soda pop in some regions. While refreshing, particularly in hot weather, excessive consumption of soft drinks can lead to various health issues like weight gain, tooth decay, and potential links to obesity and diabetes. </p>
